# shapez-mods

A personalized mod development environment for [shapez], powered by [Rollup]. Supports
TypeScript and Sass. Work in progress!

Python with NumPy, SciPy and Pillow installed is required to generate blueprint images for
the buildings. The `blueprint.py` Python script is based on the upstream source code.
`@napi-rs/canvas` is used for manual atlas stitching.
