# Structural

Structural is a mod that allows you to use simpler structural shape codes while setting
shapes for constant signals. These codes are often used to describe different kinds of
floating shapes. A simple example is `0110:1001`, which is equal to `--CuCu--:Cu----Cu` in
regular notation. However, there are additional features for advanced usage, such as the
ability to specify more than one color (indexed or short code).

## Shapez Industries support

Structural supports Shapez Industries out of the box, no additional configuration is
required: shapes such as `__01:1___` will resolve to `____--Cu:Cu______`.

## Configuration

This mod can be configured using the built-in mod settings system.
